# EI239 - Data sturctures and algorithms

This repository contains my source code for assignments of course `EI239 - Data structures and algorithms` during my first semester of sophomore year @ SJTU.

Each directory represents one assignment, and only source code files are uploaded.

I used a code editor(`VSCode`) instead of any IDEs during development, so there's no project file. To build these assignments, you'll need to compile them manually. Just include every single file, you'll get your result.
